I've just authd scriptogr.am with my dropbox as possible use for a primary blog and webspace. I was delving into jekyll & ruhoh (static blogs) today, planing on re-releasing myself back into the public internet and in the end I've gone with ruhoh, basically the same deal as jekyll but is so much better in every way.

The reason I was going with ruhoh or jekyll to begin with is because I want to support the delvs that make them (in this case <a href="http://plusjade.com/">Jade</a>) -
I'm also getting sick and tired of what else is out there for the masses and wanted to live command line control over my blog and webspace. I've currently got an <a href="https://github.com/ruhoh/ruhoh.rb/issues/89">issue</a> with the ruhoh gem so won't be moving further on that project until it's fixed.

So that's it for my first post here, I'll sync with dropbox and see how it turns out. (Hope fully I used .MARKDOWN properly - as usual I skipped the readme and will probably have to look it up when this doesn't work..)
